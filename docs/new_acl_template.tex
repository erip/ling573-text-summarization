\begin{abstract}
  This document contains the instructions for preparing a camera-ready
  manuscript for the proceedings of ACL-2014. The document itself
  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of
  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be
  used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of
  accepted papers.  Authors are asked to conform to all the directions
  reported in this document.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The following instructions are directed to authors of papers submitted
to ACL-2014 or accepted for publication in its proceedings. All
authors are required to adhere to these specifications. Authors are
required to provide a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their
papers. \textbf{The proceedings are designed for printing on A4
  paper.}

Authors from countries in which access to word-processing systems is
limited should contact the publication chairs, Alexander Koller
(\texttt{koller@ling.uni-potsdam.de}) and Yusuke Miyao
(\texttt{yusuke@nii.ac.jp}), as soon as possible.

We will make more detailed instructions available at
\url{http://sites.google.com/site/acl2014publication}. Please check
this website regularly.


\section{System Overview}
\section{Approach}

Manuscripts must be in two-column format.  Exceptions to the
two-column format include the title, authors' names and complete
addresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and
any full-width figures or tables (see the guidelines in
Subsection~\ref{ssec:first}). {\bf Type single-spaced.}  Start all
pages directly under the top margin. See the guidelines later
regarding formatting the first page.  The manuscript should be
printed single-sided and its length
should not exceed the maximum page limit described in Section~\ref{sec:length}.
Do not number the pages.


\subsection{This is a subsection.}

We strongly prefer that you prepare your PDF files using \LaTeX\ with
the official ACL 2014 style file (acl2014.sty) and bibliography style
(acl.bst). These files are available at
\url{http://www.cs.jhu.edu/ACL2014/}. You will also find the document
you are currently reading (acl2014.pdf) and its \LaTeX\ source code
(acl2014.tex) on this website.

You can alternatively use Microsoft Word to produce your PDF file. In
this case, we strongly recommend the use of the Word template file
(acl2014.dot) on the ACL 2014 website. If you have an option, we
recommend that you use the \LaTeX2e version. If you will be
  using the Microsoft Word template, we suggest that you anonymize
  your source file so that the pdf produced does not retain your
  identity.  This can be done by removing any personal information
from your source document properties.



\subsection{This also is a subsection.}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files are usually produced from
\LaTeX\ using the \textit{pdflatex} command. If your version of
\LaTeX\ produces Postscript files, you can convert these into PDF
using \textit{ps2pdf} or \textit{dvipdf}. On Windows, you can also use
Adobe Distiller to generate PDF.

Please make sure that your PDF file includes all the necessary fonts
(especially tree diagrams, symbols, and fonts with Asian
characters). When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually
an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just
non-standard fonts.  Please make sure that you select the option of
including ALL the fonts. \textbf{Before sending it, test your PDF by
  printing it from a computer different from the one where it was
  created.} Moreover, some word processors may generate very large PDF
files, where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may
reproduce poorly. In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the
PDF. One way on some systems is to install a driver for a postscript
printer, send your document to the printer specifying ``Output to a
file'', then convert the file to PDF.

It is of utmost importance to specify the \textbf{A4 format} (21 cm
x 29.7 cm) when formatting the paper. When working with
{\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt -t a4}.

Print-outs of the PDF file on A4 paper should be identical to the
hardcopy version. If you cannot meet the above requirements about the
production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication chairs as soon as possible.


\subsection{This too is a subsection}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on A4
paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 2.5 cm
\item Top margin: 2.5 cm
\item Bottom margin: 2.5 cm
\item Column width: 7.7 cm
\item Column height: 24.7 cm
\item Gap between columns: 0.6 cm
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size.
 If you cannot meet the above requirements about the production of your electronic submission, please contact the publication chairs above as soon as possible.


\subsection{You get it.}

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer
  Modern Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about
  10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.

\section{Results}

ACL 2014 innovates over earlier years in that we will attempt to
automatically convert your \LaTeX\ source files to machine-readable
XML with semantic markup. This will facilitate future research that
uses the ACL proceedings themselves as a corpus.

We encourage you to submit a ZIP file of your \LaTeX\ sources along
with the camera-ready version of your paper. We will then convert them
to XML automatically, using the LaTeXML tool
(\url{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML}). LaTeXML has \emph{bindings} for
a number of \LaTeX\ packages, including the ACL 2014 stylefile. These
bindings allow LaTeXML to render the commands from these packages
correctly in XML. For best results, we encourage you to use the
packages that are officially supported by LaTeXML, listed at
\url{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/manual/included.bindings}





\section{Discussion}

It is also advised to supplement non-English characters and terms
with appropriate transliterations and/or translations
since not all readers understand all such characters and terms.
Inline transliteration or translation can be represented in
the order of: original-form transliteration ``translation''.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:length}

Long papers may consist of up to 9 pages of content, plus two extra
pages for references. Short papers may consist of up to 5 pages of
content, plus two extra pages for references.  Papers that do not
conform to the specified length and formatting requirements may be
rejected without review.
