 A nine-year study coinciding with burgeoning development in and around Banff National Park has found the area's grizzly bears have the lowest reproductive rate ever recorded in North America, scientists at the University of Calgary said.
 That means if grizzly deaths spike, it could tip the species into an "extinction vortex," said Michael Scott, director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition.
 Federal bear biologists contend the rust is moving more slowly in Yellowstone than in northwest Montana and that the trees have co-evolved with mountain pine beetles for thousands of years.
