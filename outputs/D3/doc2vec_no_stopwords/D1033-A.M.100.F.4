 Television and newspapers have released what they called a taped private conversation between Hong Seok-Hyun and a top official of the country's largest conglomerate Samsung in 1997.
 The businessman is suspected of leaking the conversation to the media after his attempt to blackmail Samsung for ransom in return for the tape failed.
