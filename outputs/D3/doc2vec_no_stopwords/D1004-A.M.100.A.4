PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Huge sea waves set off by an earthquake crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast, killing at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's National Disaster Center said.
``There are still people out there who are injured that we have not rescued,'' he said.
``The lagoon is filled with debris, coconut palms and what used to be houses.''
