 Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three million barrels.
 The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of 130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day.
 Statoil however said it could take some time to reach even such limited production goals.
