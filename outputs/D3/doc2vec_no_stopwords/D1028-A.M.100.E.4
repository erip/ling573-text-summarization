In Sacramento, California, where Kaczynski has been jailed since early summer, the U.S. Marshals Service moved Kaczynski to the county public defender's office for the cross-country arraignment.
Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
