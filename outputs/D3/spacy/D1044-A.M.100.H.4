Britain's Food Standards Agency on Friday issued an urgent warning advising people not to eat more than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal dye.
The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
The dye got into a batch of chilli powder which was used in a large consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce made by Premier Foods.
