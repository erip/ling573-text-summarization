 Canada, whose exports of beef products are effected by a single case of mad cow disease since may 2003, has exceeded its mad cow testing target for 2004, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported Sunday.
The United States and many other countries imposed bans on Canadian beef after the discovery.
 Canada has been testing cattle for BSE since 1992, but boosted testing levels after a single case of mad cow disease was found in Alberta in May 2003.
 It is estimated the mad cow crisis has cost the Canadian beef industry and rural economies about 5 billion US dollars.
