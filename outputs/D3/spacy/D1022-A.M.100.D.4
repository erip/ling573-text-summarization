 An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale sanctuary.
 Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said the judge had upheld the government's view that it was not appropriate to pursue the campaign against whaling in the Australian courts.
 In rejecting the application, Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction there.
