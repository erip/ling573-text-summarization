Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, speaking at a joint press conference with French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, said: "Lebanon is an independent country and its judiciary is independent."
"The Lebanese people will be the protectors of the fairness of the investigation, especially if this case is dealt with the required transparency," Saud said.
