 At least eight others were also killed, including some of Hariri's bodyguards.
 Hariri had joined a chorus of objection to interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.
 Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
 The explosion, apparently caused by a car bomb, occurred around 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), when Hariri's motorcade of four black limousines escorted by jeeps was passing by in the seafront area of the capital.
He came to office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years.
