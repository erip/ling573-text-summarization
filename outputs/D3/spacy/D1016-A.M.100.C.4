Christianto said most of the wealth had been accumulated through business deals full of collusion, corruption and nepotism such as monopolies, rent-seeking practices and oligopolies.
Meanwhile, according to a survey result by the Indonesian Business Data Center which was published here Monday, the assets of Soeharto's family have reached 200 trillion rupiah (about 20 billion U.S. dollars).
He refused to disclose the details, saying that the investigation needs a long time.
Soedjono said that he has assigned junior Attorney General to carry out the investigation.
However, a foreign media once estimated Soeharto's and his family's fortune is worth 40 billion U.S. dollars.
