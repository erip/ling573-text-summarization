 Yushchenko, who repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political rivals, returned Friday to Austria to receive further treatment.
 Yushchenko, 50, spent a period at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic in September and October after falling ill for unknown reasons.
 Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
 "There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," the doctor told a news conference at the hospital. "
