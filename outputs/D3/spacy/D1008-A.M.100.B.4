For weeks this fall, even as St. Mary's County celebrated the beginning of oyster season with festivals and contests, Tucker and Agnes Brown couldn't find oysters.
Most days, the stainless steel sinks and tables inside their shuck house were shining, untouched.
Leaves yellowed and crab apples fell, and often the radio played country songs to no one, echoing through the empty cinderblock building.
``We're dead in the water,'' Tucker Brown said.
The decline of the region's oyster population has changed life on the water, but the Browns keep looking ahead.
