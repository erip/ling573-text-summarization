Days of heavy snowfall and an ensuing drop in temperatures forced an adult giant panda to hobble downhill for help at weekend in southwestern Sichuan Province, the Beijing Morning Post reported.
The panda was critically ill and had fallen into a coma when she was spotted Sunday morning by a passing driver beside a road six km from the famous Wolong giant panda research and conservation center, the paper said on Tuesday.
