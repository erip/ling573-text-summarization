CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.
``Down, Down USA!''
and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!''
the crowd chanted as Gadhafi punched the air with his fist in Martyrs' Square in the Libyan capital Tripoli.
The sentiment was echoed around the Middle East, where leaders and many citizens roundly criticized Thursday's American attacks on a factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
