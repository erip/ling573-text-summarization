Bil Mar is a division of Sara Lee Corp. The culprit, investigators say, is a strain of air and soil-borne bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes, which is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come into contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat.
The agency is studying whether some of the Bil Mar products might contain the Listeria bacteria.
