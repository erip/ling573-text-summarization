When the first reports of a food-poisoning outbreak from hot dogs and deli meats started to accumulate in state health departments across the United States last August, officials could not have guessed that the effort to contain the eruption would be so ineffective that they would still be counting victims five months later.
A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22.
But some state public health officials say the outbreak could have been contained sooner had the Agriculture Department done its job.
