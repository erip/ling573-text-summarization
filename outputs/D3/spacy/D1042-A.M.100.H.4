Army Pfc.
Lynndie R. England formally pleaded guilty Monday to mistreating inmates at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, with many of the seven counts related to her appearance in some of the most graphic photographs of the abuse that shocked the world last spring.
Under a deal she made with military prosecutors, the reservist from Fort Ashby, W.Va.,
will serve less than the maximum term of 11 years in prison that could result from her guilty plea.
She had faced nine counts and could have received up to 16 1/2 years.
A military jury here will decide her sentence this week.
