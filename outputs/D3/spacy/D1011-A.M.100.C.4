 Psychologist Maria D'Alessio said her study "shows the threat caused by commercials aimed at children and featuring foodstuffs, because it distorts one's natural relationship with food".
 Italy's TV channels broadcast twice as many commercials featuring food as their US counterparts, threatening children who watch them with serious eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia, according to a study published here Tuesday.
 "In the coming years, we will certainly have to face the problem of anorexia and bulimia," in Italian children.
 D'Alessio said 40 commercials in every hour of programming were dedicated to food. "
