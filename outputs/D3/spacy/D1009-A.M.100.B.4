BOULDER, Colo. _ Nearly two years after JonBenet Ramsey was murdered in her home here on Christmas night, a grand jury investigation moves at a pace that many outsiders call leisurely.
The second anniversary of the strangulation death of the beauty princess will find the 12 grand jurors on a five-week Christmas break.
This comes after the jurors took one week off for Thanksgiving.
During a 10-week stretch this fall, the panel met only 18 times to investigate the case, a murder mystery that has fascinated the nation and much of the world.
