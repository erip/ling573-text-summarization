AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to boost his daily workouts at the gym, Jeff Bowers turned recently to a popular herbal supplement to increase his metabolism.
Bowers bought the ephedrine-based product, Ripped Fuel, at a health food store in San Antonio.
But after only a few days of using it as directed to try and heighten athletic performance and burn fat, Bowers suffered an attack.
``I could feel my heart pounding through my shirt, my hands were jittery and I was hyperventilating, so my roommate took me to the emergency room,'' he recalled in a recent interview.
