Norwegian oil group Statoil said Monday that production on two of its platforms in the North Sea shut down last week because of a gas leak would probably remain suspended until at least next week.
"It is probably impossible to say anything until the end of next week end about the date at which the Snorre A and Vigdis (platforms) will be able to resume activity," Statoil, the operator of the two installations, said in a statement.
On November 28, the company shut down Snorre A after a gas leak was detected.
