NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case.
Those officers told associates that they grew more suspicious when two of them got out of their car to question him and he retreated into the vestibule of the building, the people knowledgeable about the case said on Tuesday.
