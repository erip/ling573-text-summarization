In Anguilla, the government closed schools Friday and residents put up hurricane shutters, in case the storm veered in their direction.
It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 mph.
Hurricane-force winds extended about 105 miles from the storm's center, and tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles.
It was too early to tell if the storm would threaten the Bahamas, which lie far north of other Caribbean islands.
Floyd was expected to be east of the Bahamas in about three days.
Still, it was recommended that people along the U.S. southeast monitor the storm's course this weekend.
