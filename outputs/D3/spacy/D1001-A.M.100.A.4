Fifteen people, including the two killers, died Tuesday in a shooting and bombing spree at Columbine High School.
BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan says stricter gun laws could not have prevented the deadly school shootings in Littleton, Colo. ``The question is who has the weapons, the good people or those who are ugly and warped,'' he said.
``The massacre is a tragic reflection of the dark side of American society,'' Buchanan told reporters Wednesday.
