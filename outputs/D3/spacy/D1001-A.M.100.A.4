LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School students are to return to class has been delayed because so many have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
The students are scheduled to begin classes Monday at another school a few miles away in afternoon sessions until the end of the year, said Barbara Monseu, area administrator for the Jefferson County School District.
Students were originally scheduled to go back Thursday.
