 China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
 The finance department of the Heilongjiang provincial government has allocated 10 million yuan (approximately 1.23 million US dollars) specially for handling the pollution incident, said the official.
It also organized environmental, water conservancy and chemical experts to discuss pollution control plans, and beefed up monitoring work.
 The official said upon receiving the report, the administration immediately sent experts to Heilongjiang Province to assist local pollution-control efforts.
