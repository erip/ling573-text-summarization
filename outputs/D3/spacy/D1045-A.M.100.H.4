Songhua River will carry poisonous substances to Harbin, a major city in northeast China, at round 5:00 a.m. Thursday, an official said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
A spokesman for the Heilongjiang provincial government said that the poisonous organic substances, mainly high-density benzene and nitrobenzene flowing down the Songhua River, will arrive in this provincial capital early Thursday.
