LOS ANGELES _ For the last two years, Mari Frank has spent more than 500 hours and $10,000 to clear her name because a Ventura, Calif., woman assumed her identity, stole her credit record and racked up debt along the way.
``She got a red convertible Mustang in my name. ...
I think she's still driving it,'' Frank said.
Prosecutors said Frank was the victim of the fastest-growing crime in America: identity theft.
Starting on Friday, California will become only the ninth state to prosecute identity theft as a felony.
