A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
Pam Morret and her husband, Lynn, missed the big eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.
They sure were not going to miss this one.
So they donned their leather jackets, chaps and bandanas, hopped on their motorcycles, and began cruising up Highway 504 _ past a theater that that airs the 1980 footage every 45 minutes, past trinket shops hawking statues made of volcano bits, past a lodge that happily warned travelers: "Watch your ash up there!"
