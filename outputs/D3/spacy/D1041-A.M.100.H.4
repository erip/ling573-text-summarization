More than 58 percent of world coral reefs have been threatened by human pressure and weather change, said an press release issued on Saturday by a world conservation meeting held here.
"With so many reefs endangered, efforts to save corals could be overlooked," Carl Gustaf Lundin, Head of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Global Marine Program was quoted by the press release as saying.
IUCN on Friday launched a report named "2004 Status of Coral Reefs of the World" at the 3rd World Conservation Conference, which is being held in Bangkok from Nov. 17 to Nov. 25.
