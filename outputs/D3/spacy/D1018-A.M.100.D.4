Almost a week after arresting the son of a prominent Dutch judge in the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, officials in Aruba searched his home Wednesday.
Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
Investigators towed two vehicles from the property, a blue SUV and a red Jeep, and removed garbage bags of items while media trained cameras on the modest, one-story yellow stucco home.
