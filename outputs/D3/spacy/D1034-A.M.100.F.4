Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs, salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most endangered class of animals on Earth, with their rapid decline outpacing that of mammals and birds.
David B. Wake of the University of California-Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, one of the world's leading amphibian experts, called the prospects for their survival ``very grim.''
