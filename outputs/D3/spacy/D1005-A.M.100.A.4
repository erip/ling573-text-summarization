Speaking clearly and appearing in good form, Pope John Paul II said Sunday that he was united in spirit with Roman Catholics attending a congress in Mexico.
The pontiff, who addressed a crowd in St. Peter's Square from a high window, noted that the World Eucharistic Congress opened Sunday in the Mexican city of Guadalajara.
"I am spiritually united with this important ecclesiastic event," the pope said in his weekly address.
The Mexican government had invited the pontiff to make a sixth visit to Mexico for the gathering.
