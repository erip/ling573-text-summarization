Bangladesh would airlift and ship 1, 000 metric tons of high energy biscuits (HEB) for the tsunami victims of Indonesia and Sri Lanka this week.
The official news agency BSS Monday quoted the sources at the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation as saying that the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) would airlift a part of the food to Sumatra immediately after availability of aircraft and that the rest would be shipped for Sri Lanka in the next couple of days.
Officials said the government was providing extensive support to the WFP for sending the relief to the tsunami victims.
