CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan and Afghanistan.
``Down, Down USA!''
and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!''
U.S. President Clinton said the strikes were ordered to avenge the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and because of reports that more anti-American attacks were being planned.
