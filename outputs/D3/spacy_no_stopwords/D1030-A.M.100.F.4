The campaign was outlined at a national anti-drug conference late last month, and announced today by the National Committee of Narcotics Control (NCNC).
The NCNC demanded party and government bodies at all levels concentrate on the problems of drug use, planting and trafficking.
Departments concerned must avoid wranglings over duties and responsibilities and coordinate with each other, it was urged.
