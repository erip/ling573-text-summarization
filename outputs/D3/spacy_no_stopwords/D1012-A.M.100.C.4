 Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
 Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there were no immediate signs of survivors.
 Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis cut short a long holiday weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting.
