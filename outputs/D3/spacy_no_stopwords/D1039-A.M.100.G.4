 The 47-year-old filmmaker, who was the great great nephew of the late 19th-century artist Vincent van Gogh, caused an uproar this summer among the Dutch Muslim community with his short film "Submission" about Islam and women.
 Dutch chief prosecutor Leo de Wit said the suspect arrested at the scene was a 26-year-old Amsterdam man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
 He left a note on the body of the victim, De Wit confirmed, while declining to reveal the contents.
