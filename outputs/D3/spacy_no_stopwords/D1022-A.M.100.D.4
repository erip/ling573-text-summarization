 Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.
 However, Allsop granted the animal rights group permission to appeal his decision to the full bench of the Federal Court.
 "A successful appeal to the full Federal Court could force the government to go beyond hitting Japan with rhetoric," Kennedy said.
