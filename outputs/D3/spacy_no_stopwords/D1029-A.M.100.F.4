 Eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured in fierce desert gunbattles with tribal rebels in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, officials said Friday.
 A ceasefire was agreed to remove the dead and wounded from the site of the day-long exchange of machinegun fire in Dera Bugti southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, officials said.
 An assertion by opposition politician Hafiz Hussain Ahmed that up to 50 tribesmen were killed in the incident was "exaggerated," Sherpao and Cheema said.
