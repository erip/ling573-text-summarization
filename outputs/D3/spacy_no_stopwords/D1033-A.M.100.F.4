 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
 Kim, 79, had been feeling weak and had a mild fever for a few days, Kim's secretary Choi Gyung-hwan said in a statement.
 But his legacy has been tarnished over the scandal that the government made secret payments ahead of the 2000 summit, and also this year over revelations that the intelligence agency engaged in illegal wiretapping during much of his administration.
