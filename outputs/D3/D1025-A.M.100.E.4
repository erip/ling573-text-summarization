At least 25 bears died in the greater Yellowstone area last year, including eight breeding-age females killed by people.
The only way the bear is going to survive in the Yellowstone Ecosystem is to have public support for it.
These bears live in the same three states and Washington.
And the reddish crowns of dying whitebark pines continue to advance across Yellowstone.
