Initial studies have found that pandas have different blood types, but researchers have not conducted in-depth studies and lack sufficient knowledge about this, centre deputy chief engineer Huang Yan said.

The three Beijing giant pandas about to leave were born respectively in 1991, 1999 and 2003, and one of the three Sichuan pandas was also born last year.
