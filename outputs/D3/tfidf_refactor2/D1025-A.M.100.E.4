Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
"The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
The National Wildlife Federation supports delisting, saying it highlights the success of the endangered species law.
This plan doesn't do it.''
