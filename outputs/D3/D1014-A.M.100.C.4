ABU DHABI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A massive increase in the incidence of diabetes has been forecast for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) nationals unless education and preventive measures are taken, a medical study said.
About 11 percent of national men and 14 percent of women had diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years, according to the study released by UAE's medical center today.
The study, involving 2,000 UAE nationals aged between 30 and 80 years, found diabetes in the UAE to be particularly widespread among the elderly and less educated social groups.
