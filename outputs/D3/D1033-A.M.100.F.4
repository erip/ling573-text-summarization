President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday said he will accept the resignation of South Korea's ambassador to the United States, who is stepping down over a burgeoning scandal surrounding the East Asian country's 1997 presidential election.
Ambassador Hong Seok-hyun called the presidential chief of staff, Kim Woo-sik, late Monday to say that he would resign.
"I feel sorry because he has been doing a good job as ambassador to the United States at a crucial period," Roh was quoted as saying by Kim Man-soo, the presidential spokesman.
It didn't elaborate.
