 Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
 "There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally administered," the doctor told a news conference at the hospital. "
We suspect a cause triggered by a third party."
 "There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin," said Michael Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment.
 Yushchenko, 50, spent a period at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic in September and October after falling ill for unknown reasons.
