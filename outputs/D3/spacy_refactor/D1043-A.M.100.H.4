 Crowds had begun jamming the streets in Martyr's Square in downtown Beirut since 9:30 a.m.  As a result the procession found it difficult to enter and did not arrive in time for the regular noonday prayers at the massive Mohammed Amine mosque, an impressive building with four minarets that is to replace a mosque destroyed in the civil war.
 The family believes that Hariri's death was caused in part by the government's failure to provide security, and at their request no government officials attended the funeral.
