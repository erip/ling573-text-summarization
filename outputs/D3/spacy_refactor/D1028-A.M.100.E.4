Prosecutors have said they hope to decide before January whether to seek the death penalty, which Kaczynski could also face for the two California bombing deaths.
Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.
Federal authorities believe he used bombs to kill three people and injure 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
Debevoise also heard arguments on a defense request to transfer the New Jersey case to Sacramento, where a November trial date has been set.
