 Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
 Japan has said it will push for a widening of its research whaling program at a meeting of the IWC that began in Ulsan, South Korea last week.
 The group's director, Michael Kennedy, said he would appeal the decision within the next two weeks.
