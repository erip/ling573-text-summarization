 It has emerged as an issue now because the native oyster -- crucial to filtering the bay's waters and supporting its fleet of watermen -- has almost vanished from the Chesapeake.
 Delaware and New Jersey will not have a say.
 They worry that the Asian oysters could bring new diseases or adapt to the Chesapeake so well that they squeeze out native species of oysters and clams.
 ``We are not going to introduce an oyster that we have questions about,'' said Secretary of Natural Resources Ronald Franks.
