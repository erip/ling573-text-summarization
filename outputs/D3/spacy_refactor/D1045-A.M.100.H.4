 A spokesman for the Heilongjiang provincial government said that the poisonous organic substances, mainly high-density benzene and nitrobenzene flowing down the Songhua River, will arrive in this provincial capital early Thursday.
 He said the pollutant strip will flow out of Harbin Saturday morning.
 The municipal government of Harbin has notified local residents about the coming pollution so that people have enough time to store water.
 The river is the main source of drinking water supply to Harbin, a city of more than 3 million people.
