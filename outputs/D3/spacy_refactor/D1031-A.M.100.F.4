 The death toll in the catastrophe in Indonesia's Aceh and North Sumatra provinces alone reached more than 80,000 on Thursday.
 The estimate of the tsunami-prone areas was based on similar disasters affecting the areas previously, the office's chief, Yousana Siagian, was quoted by the official Antara news agency as saying.
 To avoid tsunami, people should neither reside in the areas close to coastlines nor destroy mangrove forests that protect tidal waves, he said from the agency's compound in Bandung, West Java.
