 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) Monday extended the list of foods contaminated by carcinogenic colouring that it wants to recall from shop shelves and homes.
 The watchdog agency Friday recalled 359 products, ranging from ready-made-meals to a popular brand of instant noodles, after finding traces of the illegal dye Sudan I.  "Sudan I can contribute to an increased risk of cancer but at the levels present the risk is likely to be very small," the agency said in a statement.
 The 38 new items include certain sausages, seasonings and pizzas.
