Han Xingguo, of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, says that the Himalayas acts as a natural protective screen, stopping cold air from the north, while warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain.
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.
