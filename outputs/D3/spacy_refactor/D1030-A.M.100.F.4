The NCNC demanded party and government bodies at all levels concentrate on the problems of drug use, planting and trafficking.
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will carry out a massive targeted fight against narcotics-related crimes from this month through the end of September, to curb rampant drug smuggling and the increase of drug use.
More importantly, the NCNC said, criminals involved in drug-related activities must be dealt with strictly in accordance with law, and fines should never be levied in place of harsher punishment.
