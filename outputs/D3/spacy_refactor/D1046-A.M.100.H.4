 A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there.
 The Chinese team arrived in Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, at 05:10 a.m. local time by a chartered plane.
They will leave for Aceh Province later in the day.
 The aid includes medicines, tents, food, two off-road vehicles, a motor boat, field kitchens, drinking water and helicopter parts.
 Uzbekistan on Monday sent a plane with 35 metric tons (39 short tons) of humanitarian aid to tsunami-hit Indonesia, the Foreign Ministry said.
