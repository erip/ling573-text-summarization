 Last year, Arafat suffered from gall stones, and his aides denied rumors he had stomach cancer.
 Arafat caught his cold last Tuesday, while walking in the windy courtyard of his Ramallah headquarters, the aides said.
 Arafat no longer has fever or nausea, but the stuffy nose remains, his aide said.
 The health of the 75-year-old has been a subject of intense speculation in recent years, in part because of the tremor in his lips and hands, considered as a possible symptom of Parkinson's disease.
