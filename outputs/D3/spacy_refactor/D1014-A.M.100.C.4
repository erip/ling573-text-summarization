Alcohol targets were set because too much drink raises the blood pressure, increasing the risk of stroke, and is blamed for liver cirrhosis, cancers and road traffic accidents.
Only 11 of the 27 targets set by the Department of Health to reduce premature death and avoidable sickness by promoting sensible lifestyles look certain to be reached, according to an official report.
However, the Health Department is refusing to consider a ban on cigarette and alcohol advertising, saying it is up to the public to change lifestyles, following government health education.
