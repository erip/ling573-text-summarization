Just before noon on Friday, seismometers at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., wiggled in a familiar pattern.
The pulsations of steam and dust on Friday, described by Major as "a relatively small burp," sent a gray-white plume nearly 10,000 feet into the air.
After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been rumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting that pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now.
Seismic activity resumed later in the afternoon, Major said, but at a quieter level.
