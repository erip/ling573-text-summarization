Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a presidential election in late 1997.
 The People's Solidarity of Participatory Democracy, an influential civic group, filed a petition Monday with state prosecutors against Lee, Hong and the Samsung chief.
Lee retired from politics after he failed in his second presidential bid in 2002.
 Ruling and opposition party lawmakers have urged Hong to step down but Roh did not comment on his fate, the spokesman said.
 Samsung apologized Monday over the issue. "
We sincerely apologize for causing turmoil over media reports on illegally taped conversations," the group said in a statement.
