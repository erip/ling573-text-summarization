South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on Monday ordered the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to thoroughly investigate the allegation that one of the nation's biggest conglomerates provided huge slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
Roh made the remarks while presiding over a weekly meeting with senior presidential aides in earlier Monday, Roh's spokesman Kim Man-soo said.
However, the South Korean president did not mention the fate of the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal, according to the spokesman.
