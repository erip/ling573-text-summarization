A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms.
Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms, said Yu, who is on a fact-finding tour in Shenzhen.
