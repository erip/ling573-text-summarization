Kaczynski, arrested in Montana in April 1996, has pleaded not guilty to the Sacramento charges accusing him of four bomb attacks, in which two people were killed.
David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the Unabomber.
He faces a later trial in Newark, New Jersey, on federal charges that he mailed a package bomb that killed advertising executive Thomas Mosser in New Jersey.
