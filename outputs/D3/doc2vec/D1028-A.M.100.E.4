WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The names, addresses and employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on November 12 in Sacramento, California.
Unabomber, the mail bomb terrorist, killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
He is also charged with a third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. issued that order today in denying a news media motion to make juror names public, according to news reports.
