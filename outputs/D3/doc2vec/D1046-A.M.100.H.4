Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Wednesday that his country would provide 1 billion Australian dollars (about 764 million US dollars) in loans and grants to assist Indonesia in its rebuilding after the Dec. 26 earthquake-tsunami disaster.
This was the biggest single aid package in Australia's history, Howard told a press conference in Jakarta.
Half of the assistance will be in the form of grants for short term relief and the remainder in loans for long term reconstruction, Howard said.
