 "Reaching this year's target ahead of schedule shows that Canada is taking its surveillance responsibilities seriously," Agriculture Minister Andy Mitchell said in the release.
 The federal government is increasing the number of cattle tested to 30,000 in 2005 and subsequent years.
The target was 8,000 cattle tested by the end of 2004.
 As of October 27, more than 8,600 animals were tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow, the agency said in a news release.
 The testing process is aimed at high-risk cattle that are showing signs of disease, such as aged or downer animals.
