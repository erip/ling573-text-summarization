The growth will be registered in both developed and, especially, developing countries, due to population aging, unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle.
According to the U.N. health agency, about 20 percent of diabetics develop the so-called insulin-dependent form of diabetes, or IDDM, and live on with insulin injections, while about 30 percent of the non-IDDM cases may use insulin injections to control their conditions.
The WHO considers insulin an essential drug.
However, it noted that in some developing countries, the drug that turns the once fatal IDDM into a treatable disease is still unavailable or unaffordable.
