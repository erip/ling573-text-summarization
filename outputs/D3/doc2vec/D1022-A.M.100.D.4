New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
Campbell said he would visit key European players in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) -- including France, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden -- to reinforce Australia's anti-whaling position.
He said he would also discuss the issue with key Pacific nations ahead of an IWC vote at a meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, late next month.
