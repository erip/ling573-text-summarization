China and Russia have both pledged to cooperate closely to handle the pollution of the Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Thursday.
Liu said China was very concerned about possible hazards to Russia and has informed its neighbor several times of the pollution.
Zhang Lijun, deputy director general of SEPA said China would keep Russia informed at all times about the monitoring results of the polluted stretches of Songhua River.
The two countries are setting concrete arrangements to open a hot line for better contact and communication over the water problem.
