The explosion killed 57 people, triggered the largest landslide in recorded history and blew 520 million tons of ash eastward across the United States.
 After the 1980 eruption, a lahar traveled 50 miles from Mount St. Helens, ripping out bridges and destroying homes.
 In comparison, Friday's eruption was a ``hiccup,'' USGS geologist Tom Pierson told reporters.
 About 20 minutes after Friday's eruption, the mountain calmed and the plume began to dissipate.
 But USGS seismologist Bob Norris said magma could be moving underground and he would not be surprised to see more explosions in the next days or weeks.
