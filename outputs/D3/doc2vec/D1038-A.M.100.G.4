Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
Castle Rock residents, many of whom witnessed the 1980 explosion, which dumped truckloads of ash on this town, seemed to be taking the new development in stride and expressed little worry on Saturday, saying nothing could compare to the 1980 event.
