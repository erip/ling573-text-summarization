These bears live in the same three states and Washington.
Dominic Domenici, the Fish and Wildlife Service resident agent in charge of enforcement for Montana and Wyoming, said there ``are more conflicts now between elk hunters and bears,'' in part because the whitebark pine seeds grizzlies need are in shorter supply now due to a beetle infestation induced by warming climate.
And removing protection, they say, would not allow the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to halt development in a crucial grizzly habitat.
