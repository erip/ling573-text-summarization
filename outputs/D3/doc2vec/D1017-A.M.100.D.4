Floyd was expected to intensify, and it was unlikely to hit land soon.
It posed no immediate threat to the United States coast.
``But it's not going to threaten any land anywhere over the weekend,'' said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center.
Five Caribbean islands canceled tropical storm watches Friday night as Floyd, packing winds of 110 mph, moved further out to sea, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
It was expected to move west-northwest at 12 mph.
