Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months annually, but the RSSs can do that.
Brazil, which is in charge of the design of the RSS, plans to build a land-monitoring base in the Cuiaba city, located in Amazon's Pantanal wetlands.
Director of the Brazilian institute, Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, recently visited Malaysia to negotiate the joint launching of the RSSs, a project which is estimated to last eight years.
