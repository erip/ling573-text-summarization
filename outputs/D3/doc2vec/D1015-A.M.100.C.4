The launching of the RSSs, the first of this kind of satellite on a permanent orbit 900 kilometers above the equator, is estimated to cost 37 millon U.S. dollars.
The RSSs will monitor 2,200 square kilometers of the Amazon rain forest, which it will pass over every 105 minutes, said Brazil's National Institute of Space Research.
Satellites currently monitoring the region cannot see clearly through the thick clouds which cover the region for several months annually, but the RSSs can do that.
