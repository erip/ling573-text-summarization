The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May 2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined.
She concluded her argument by playing a snippet of an interview Blake gave ABC's Barbara Walters in which he said no matter what happens to him, his daughter will be kept away from Bakley's family.
