 As early as the night of Bakley's murder, Blake ``did some suspicious things'' that led detectives at the scene to focus on him as a possible suspect, Samuels said.
 Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there was no mention of killing Bakley.
 "All sides have rested and the case is now concluded," Judge Darlene Schempp told the jury Friday.
 The judge said closing arguments will begin Wednesday and the case will be sent to the jury Friday.
