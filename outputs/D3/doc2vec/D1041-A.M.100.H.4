Only about 30 percent of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down from 41 percent two years ago, according to a study released Monday that lists global warming as the top threat.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
Coral reefs are among the oldest and most diverse forms of life.
They provide food and shelter to fish and protect shores from erosion.
Still, he said, it's crucial to "raise the level of political will" to help reefs around the world.
