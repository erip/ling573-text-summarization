Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese mourners gathered at the Mohamed Al Amin Mosque in the capital Beirut on Wednesday to pay last tribute to former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri killed in a suicide car bombing on Monday.
Hariri was buried in the unfinished mosque which he had financed after the mass funeral procession escorting an ambulance carrying Hariri's coffin covered with national flag marched through the main streets to the mosque in central Beirut.
