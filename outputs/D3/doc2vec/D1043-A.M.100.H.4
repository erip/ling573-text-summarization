 The explosion, apparently caused by a car bomb, occurred around 1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), when Hariri's motorcade of four black limousines escorted by jeeps was passing by in the seafront area of the capital.
He came to office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years.
 Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October.
 It appeared to be the biggest bomb in the city since Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990.
 Hariri died at American University Hospital, while former Minister of Justice Samir al-Jisr and former Minister of Economy and Trade Basil Fuleihan, who were traveling in Hariri's convoy, survived the blast.
