HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is launching a support fund for victims of the defoliant Agent Orange, more than two decades after its use by U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, the Labor newspaper reported Saturday.
The fund, which primarily will rely on donations from domestic and foreign organizations and individuals, will be inaugurated next Friday.
Nhan said the government's strained budget might have delayed assistance, pointing out that a laboratory test of a sample for Agent Orange costs dlrs 3,000.
