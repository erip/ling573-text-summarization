BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai and U.S. experts would cooperate in an operation to identify the toxic chemicals recently discovered under an airport in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.
The United States has dispatched a team of experts from the Joint United States Military Assistance Group to inspect the site with Thai experts, sources close to the U.S. Embassy here said on Friday.
The strong-smelling hazardous waste was unearthed last week under the Bor Fai airport runway in Hua Hin of Prachuab Khiri Khan Province.
