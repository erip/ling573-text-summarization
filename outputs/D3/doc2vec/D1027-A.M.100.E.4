LARAMIE, Wyo. (
AP) -- Police stepped up patrols today outside the courthouse for the trial of one of two men accused of murdering gay college student Matthew Shepard.
Anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed repeatedly over the Shepard case.
Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work to remember Shepard.
He wasn't just a gay man.
Nothing can bring him back.''
Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult.''
