Vioxx and a similar drug from Pfizer Inc., Celebrex, have been touted as ``super-aspirins'' in numerous TV commercials that have downplayed their known cardiovascular risks.
 So why is Merck recalling the drug now?
Merck faces several lawsuits, including a class action filed Thursday alleging the company made false and misleading statements about Vioxx's safety.
 The second problem is the nation's almost exclusive reliance on drug companies to police the safety and efficacy of their own drugs.
 The withdrawal of Vioxx caused Merck's market value to sink by almost $27 billion.
