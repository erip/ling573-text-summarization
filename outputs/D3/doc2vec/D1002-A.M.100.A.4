After the arraignment, Kornberg said his client, Carroll, had seen a ``black object'' _ which turned out to be Diallo's wallet _ coming out of the victim's back pocket.
The officers did not know it, but it was the building where he lived.
Diallo remained silent during the whole encounter, they said.
At that point, Carroll yelled, ``Gun!''
the people knowledgeable about the case said.
Several of the officers are said to have told associates that they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they had unleashed the fusillade.
