``On a day like this we are reminded of the murder of Fortuyn,'' he added.
Chief prosecutor Leo de Wit confirmed that the killer had left a note on Van Gogh's body, the contents of which were not disclosed.
 Friends and associates said van Gogh had received anonymous death threats after Dutch television aired his controversial short film ``Submission'' in August.
The film featured four women who claimed to have been abused by their Muslim husbands and who wore see-through robes showing their breasts, with texts from the Koran scrawled on their bodies.
