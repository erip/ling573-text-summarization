England's lawyer, Rick Hernandez, asked Pohl to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.
Last week, the Army's inspector general exonerated four generals in Iraq of any blame for Abu Ghraib.
England became the eighth enlisted soldier to be found guilty of 2003 Abu Ghraib crimes that continue to taint the reputations of the United States and its military.
The prosecution dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act.
