 Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
 There is "no logic in such an accusation," said Taras Chornovyl, Yanukovych's campaign manager.
 "Evidence of American support (for Yushchenko) has surfaced more than once.
 Dioxin is a byproduct of industrial processes such as waste incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
 Yanukovych campaigners rejected suggestions that the prime minister could have been involved in poisoning Yushchenko.
