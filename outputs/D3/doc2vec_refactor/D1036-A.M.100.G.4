 Dioxins are not commercially available, Paepke said, but can be obtained through industry contacts or made in a laboratory by people with the proper skills.
Another case occurred in 1997 in Vienna, where two employees of a textile institute developed chloracne on their bodies, according to Olaf Paepke, a scientist at a Hamburg institute, who conducted chemical analysis for the investigation.
The condition occurs months to years after exposure, when the body seeks to eliminate residue of the chemical through the skin.
But Zimpfer said Yushchenko's skin nodules no longer indicated that disease.
