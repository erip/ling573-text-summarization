 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
He also held an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il that year.
 Kim won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his "sunshine" policy of engaging North Korea.
Kim has denied of any knowledge of the wiretapping.
Concerned about the possibility of an infection, Kim's doctor recommended an examination at Seoul's Severance Hospital, Choi said.
 Kim, 79, had been feeling weak and had a mild fever for a few days, Kim's secretary Choi Gyung-hwan said in a statement.
