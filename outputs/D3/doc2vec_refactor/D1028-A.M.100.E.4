In the first phase, jurors must determine if Kaczynski is the bomber who terrorized the country for 17 years, beginning in 1978.
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento, California.
Burrell said he'll form the panel when he has 12 jurors and six alternates.
Legal experts say Kaczynski's best hope is escaping the death penalty in the second phase of the trial, if he's convicted, on grounds that he has had lifelong mental problems.
