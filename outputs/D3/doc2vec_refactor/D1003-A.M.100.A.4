 The discovery of panda traces in Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau said.
 Giant pandas used to live in Fengxian County before the 1970s but later disappeared from the area owing to the construction of the railway from Baoqi in Shaanxi to the capital city of Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan province.
