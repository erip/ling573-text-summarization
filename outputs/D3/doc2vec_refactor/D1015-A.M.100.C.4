Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
Protecting the area means protecting an important gene storehouse, Han says.
KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, and after nearly four decades it has grown to 247,000 ha with most of the rain forest.
