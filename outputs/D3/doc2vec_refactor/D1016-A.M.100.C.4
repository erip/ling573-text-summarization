Djuhad Mahja SH of the United Development Party faction made the statement in the Parliament building here Thursday.
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has been found in several provinces including land, factories and others.
Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings.
