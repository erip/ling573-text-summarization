11:25 a.m. (0825 GMT) _ Fighter jets approach the plane and report that the co-pilot of the Cypriot plane appears unconscious in the cockpit, while the other pilot was absent.
 Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said.
The attempts continued until 10:55, when the lack of communication triggered Greek emergency procedures known as ''renegade alert``: the Greek air force scrambled two F-16 fighters to escort the plane to its landing.
