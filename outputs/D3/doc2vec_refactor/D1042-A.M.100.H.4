 Private Lynndie England, perhaps the most well-known in the abuse scandal that occurred in the fall of 2003, pleaded guilty to seven charges, including two counts of conspiracy to maltreat prisoners, four counts of maltreating prisoners and one count of committing an indecent act.
 England, from West Virginia, was one of seven members of the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company charged with humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib.
Asked if she had been ordered by her chain of command to mistreat inmates, England replied, "No, sir."
