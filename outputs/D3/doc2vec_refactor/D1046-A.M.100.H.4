 A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there.
 The Chinese team arrived in Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, at 05:10 a.m. local time by a chartered plane.
They will leave for Aceh Province later in the day.
 This is the second batch of relief goods China has sent to the tsunami-hit countries in south and southeast Asian countries.
 A Boeing 747 plane carrying 50 tons of relief goods left Guangzhou in south China for tsunami- stricken Indonesia Thursday, said an official of the Ministry of Commerce.
