 Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket barrage on the gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
 Authorities were also hunting the culprits behind the bombing of the Chiltan Express train heading from the eastern city of Lahore to Quetta, the latest in a series of attacks on the rail network in Baluchistan.
 The government has dismissed the tribesmen's claims that up to 50 people on their side alone were killed as "exaggerated".
 He said the attack, which he blamed on the area's dominant Bugti tribe, was "totally unprovoked and blatant aggression".
