 The loss of cells that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine causes the telltale tremors, rigid and slow movements of Parkinson's.
 The rats that had been exercised had lost significantly fewer neurons than the sedentary rats.
In doing their research, scientists take a few stem cells from very young embryos and grow them into colonies, called stem cell ``lines.''
The debate centers on whether the embryos used in stem cell research are human beings.
 Some people, including some religious groups, say embryonic stem cell research should be banned because it ends a human life.
