Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production of three million barrels, has seen its oil production reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day (bpd) since the platforms were closed.
"Statoil thinks it will be acceptable to resume partial production from its Snorre A platform in the North Sea," the company said in a statement, adding that, "a partial start-up could take place independently of remaining work with the platform wells".
