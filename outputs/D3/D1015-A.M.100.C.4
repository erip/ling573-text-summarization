HAIKOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts from across China today called for urgent action to protect the dwindling number of black gibbons in southern China's Hainan province.
A total of 150 experts and professors from 25 research institutes and colleges across the country have launched the nationwide appeal.
They called on government departments to participate in and mobilize social forces to enhance the construction and management of a natural protection zone on Bawangling Mountain, where black gibbons live.
In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties.
