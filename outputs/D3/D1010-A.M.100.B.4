Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.
The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
In late March, the United States applied to Taiwan's health department to have the ban lifted.
