(mn-lja)  Police questioned the father of a Dutch teenager detained in connection with the case of a missing American teenager, hoping he may have seen something to help resolve the mystery, officials said Sunday.
When he left (the home Friday) he said, 'I will be back this afternoon.' "
In the past week authorities released the first two suspects arrested in the case, then arrested a fourth Friday.
They staged a highly-publicized spectacle of a search of a beach where a local DJ claimed to have found a pair of women's underwear and condoms.
