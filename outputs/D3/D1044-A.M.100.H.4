 The watchdog agency Friday recalled 359 products, ranging from ready-made-meals to a popular brand of instant noodles, after finding traces of the illegal dye Sudan I.  "Sudan I can contribute to an increased risk of cancer but at the levels present the risk is likely to be very small," the agency said in a statement.
 The director of Food Standard Agency (FSA) David Statham said in a statement that "local authorities across the country have visited a number of premises to look at records and take samples," adding that "this is a major investigation".
