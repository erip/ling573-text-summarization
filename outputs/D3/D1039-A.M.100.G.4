Many here fear the fact that Van Gogh's alleged killer is of Moroccan descent could lead to ethnic tensions in Dutch society.
Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality.
Ayhan Tonca, chairman of the Dutch association for contact between Muslims and government, denounced the killing as "horrific".
Van Gogh made many enemies within the Dutch Muslim community with his often-insulting descriptions of Islam.
The filmmaker and columnist not only attacked Muslims but also Jews and gays.
