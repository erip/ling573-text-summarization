Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
The IWC meeting coincides with the start of Australia's whale watching season, when hundreds of humpbacks swim up the east coast seeking warmer waters during the southern winter.
Howard noted in his letter that some 1.6 million tourists flock to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year.
