Four people were injured and a powerline and a government office damaged in three separate bomb blasts in southwestern Pakistan's restive Baluchistan province, officials said Sunday.
Two blasts caused by home-made bombs rocked the remote town of Turbat, some 500 kilometres (310 miles) west of the provincial capital Quetta, late Saturday, Baluchistan home secretary Humayun Khan told AFP.
In one of the blasts, close to the wall of the irrigation department, four people were injured.
The other blast, near a paramilitary camp, damaged a main power line, Khan said.
The third blast late Saturday was in the provincial capital Quetta.
