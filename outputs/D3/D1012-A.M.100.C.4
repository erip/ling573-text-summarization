The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
"If the aircraft lost cabin pressure, either in the cockpit or the cabin, effectively everybody would be doomed within a short space of time," said Chris Yates, an aviation analyst at Jane's Transport.
Did the pilots not have the time to equip themselves?"
Incapacitation of both pilots on a commercial jetliner is extremely rare.
