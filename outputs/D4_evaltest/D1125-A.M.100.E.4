 This is nonsense.
Wrong.
The federal government has proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species, and the wildlife agency is receiving public comment on the proposal.
 If the polar bear were listed as a threatened species, all federal agencies would have to ensure that anything they authorize that might affect polar bears will not jeopardize their survival or the sea ice where they live.
The scientists "will not be speaking on or responding to these issues" of climate change, polar bears and sea ice, the memos say.
