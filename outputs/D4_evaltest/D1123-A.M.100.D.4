 "This is an act of terrorism.
 The Pentagon has received a report on the attack but no request for any action, a military official said in Washington.
 Greek police said a far-left group, Revolutionary Struggle, had claimed responsibility for the attack.
 It was the first major attack against a U.S. target in more than a decade, following the arrest of members of Greece's far-left November 17 terrorist group.
The Greek Police are working closely with the embassy authorities," a police statement said.
