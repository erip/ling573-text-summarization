 A blazing car crashed into the terminal building at Glasgow Airport in Scotland on Saturday, police said.
 "It is right to raise the levels of security at airports and crowded places in the light of the heightened threat," he added.
 Britain's national security alert level has been raised to "critical," the highest rating, in the wake of a car crash at Glasgow Airport on Saturday afternoon, according to the Home Office.
