 Sleep loss or disturbed sleep can heighten the risk for adolescents to take up smoking and drinking, according to a new study.
 Among other problems, increased hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, according to the researchers.
 The researchers looked at men and women sleeping less than or equal to 5 hours a night to see if their risk of developing hypertension was any higher than men and women getting the recommended 7 hours or more of sleep a night.
