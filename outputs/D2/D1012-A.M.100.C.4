the greek government on sunday ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a cypriot boeing 737 operated by the private helios airways crashed sunday north of athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members on board.
experts were also looking into what might have happened in the last minutes of the plane which was declared ``renegade ''when it entered greek air space and failed to make radio contact, causing two f-16 air force jets planes to scramble to investigate.
one report from the scene said some of the bodies were wearing orange oxygen masks.
