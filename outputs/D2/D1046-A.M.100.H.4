this is the second batch of relief goods china has sent to the tsunami-hit countries in south and southeast asian countries.
the two batches of relief goods, worth 21.63 million yuan ( 2.62 million us dollars), are mainly tents, blankets, sheets and food that are badly needed by the people affected by the tsunami.
the japanese government is committed to increase its aid for tsunami-hit aceh and north sumatra provinces to 146 million us dollars, japanese ambassador to indonesia yutaka iimura said on monday.
