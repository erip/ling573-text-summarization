there was ``no doubt ''that yushchenko's disease`` has been caused by a case of poisoning by dioxin,'' dr. michael zimpfer, president of the rudolfinerhaus hospital said at a news conference on saturday.
doctors at a vienna clinic in austria said tests proved beyond doubt that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in september that left yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
yushchenko fell sick sept. 6, the day after having late-night food and drinks with the head of the security service of ukraine, among other people.
