u.s. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to osama bin laden, whom u.s. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
u.s. officials said the factory in sudan made chemical weapons agents; sudan maintains it's a pharmaceutical plant.
