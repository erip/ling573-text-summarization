cairo, egypt ( ap) _ in mosques and in mcdonald's, arabs on friday criticized u.s. missile strikes in sudan and afghanistan as driven more by president bill clinton's need to escape scandal than by a battle against terrorism.
clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in afghanistan run by osama bin laden, the saudi millionaire blamed by washington for the aug. 7 bombings of u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania, and a factory linked to bin laden in sudan.
