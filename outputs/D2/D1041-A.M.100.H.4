regional marine programme co-ordinator for south and southeast asia with the iucn ( world conservation union) in colombo, sri lanka, jerker tamelander, said damage to the marine ecosystem could be ``very, very serious. ''
``the structures provide a foundation that is colonized by coral polyps and in time becomes thickly encrusted with living coral, providing an ecosystem in which marine life can thrive,`` a coa official said.
more than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the world conservation union ( iucn) said friday.
