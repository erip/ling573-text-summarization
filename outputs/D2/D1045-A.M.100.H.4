currently, the water supply has been cut off in harbin, capital of northeast china's heilongjiang province, as the city's water source, songhua river, has been heavily polluted.
china's state environmental protection administration ( sepa) said here on wednesday that the songhua river in northeast china suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
``after the explosion at the jilin petrochemical company under china national petroleum corporation, our observation showed pollutants containing benzene had flown into the songhua river and caused water pollution, ''said an official with sepa.
