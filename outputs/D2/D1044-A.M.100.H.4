britain's food safety watchdog thursday added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall yet.
the total number of affected goods, ranging from ready-made-meals to popular sauces, came to 474 after a previous list of some 430 items issued by the food standards agency ( fsa) was found to have a number of duplications, it said.
``the vast majority of products contaminated with the illegal dye sudan i have been removed from sale, ''the agency said in a statement.
