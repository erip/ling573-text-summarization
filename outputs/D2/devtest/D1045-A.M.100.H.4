 China focus: China pledges to minimize impact of river pollution on Russia  By Tian Sulei, Wang Jingzhong and Wang Jiangang  BEIJING, Nov.
 China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the upper reaches.
 Two reservoirs on the Songhua River on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang.
