 The Australian government on Friday foiled a court bid by international animal rights activists to stop a Japanese company from killing whales inside the country's Antarctic sanctuary.
 Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.
 New Zealand is seeking all options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to kill endangered humpback whales, local media said Monday.
