 Researchers at Florida's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution have discovered that this year's rash of hurricanes scoured damaging seaweed, known scientifically as macroalgae, from coral reefs off the Florida coast, though they warned it is likely to come back.
 Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.''
 For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
