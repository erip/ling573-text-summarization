hariri was buried in the unfinished mosque which he had financed after the mass funeral procession escorting an ambulance carrying hariri's coffin covered with national flag marched through the main streets to the mosque in central beirut.
it was too early to say who killed hariri who resigned as prime minister last october though oppositions held syria and its allied lebanese government responsible for hariri's murder.
a previously unknown islamic group on monday claimed responsibility for an earlier killing of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri due to his ties with saudi arabia, the qatar-based al-jazeera tv channel reported.
