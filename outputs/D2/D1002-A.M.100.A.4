new york _ the rev.
the three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white officers who fired 41 bullets at african immigrant amadou diallo in the wee hours of feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of his bronx apartment building.
the defense lawyers called their clients ``political prisoners, ''and said they would show the incident was`` a tragedy, not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable ''cause to believe diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired.
