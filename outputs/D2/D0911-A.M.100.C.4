chess genius bobby fischer, now in a japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the united states, will be allowed to leave japan for iceland if that country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader said wednesday.
iceland's parliament voted monday to grant icelandic citizenship to the american chess champion bobby fischer, laying the groundwork, his supporters said, for his release from the japanese prison where he has been detained since last summer.
