zamboanga, philippines ( ap) -- muslim rebels who have been holding 27 filipinos hostage at a remote mountain stronghold in the philippines claimed responsibility tuesday for also abducting about 20 people from a nearby malaysian tourist island.
philippine officials, however, expressed skepticism over the claim by the extremist abu sayyaf rebels.
the 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort workers, were abducted late sunday from malaysia's sipadan island by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the philippines, officials said.
