The Legislative Yuan will pass a resolution against Beijing's anti-secession legislation, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday.
China's enactment of the Anti- Secession Law, as part of the overarching principle, is to closely focus on the theme of opposing and checking the secessionist activities of the "Taiwan independence" forces and promoting China 's peaceful reunification, a senior Chinese lawmaker said here Tuesday.
