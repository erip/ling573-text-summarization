Sri Lankan government has finalised a set of counter proposals to the Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA) proposal put forward by the Tamil Tiger rebles, the government spokesman said here Thursday.
Two members belonging to the mainstream Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were killed in a shooting incident that happened late Thursday night at the eastern Batticaloa district's Punkudawali area controlled by the LTTE rebels.
Switzerland has a large community of Sri Lankan Tamil emigrants, and the country's decentralised federal political system has been cited as a potential model for the Indian Ocean island.
