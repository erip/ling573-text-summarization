Zarnecki and other scientists have equipped the 700-pound stationary probe well: Huygens can measure its tilt to figure out if it lands on solid or liquid.
The move will also help establish the required geometry between the probe and the orbiter for radio communications during the European probe's descent.
Friday evening, tension-loaded springs will push Huygens away from Cassini on a free-fall toward Titan.
Titan's strong winds could blow it hundreds of miles across the surface.
And scientists hope the on-site probe by Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them to better understand how life appears on Earth.
