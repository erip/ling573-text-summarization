Oct 30: Palestinian officials deny reports that Arafat is suffering from leukemia or that he has lost his faculties.
Abed Rabbo told reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah that the reports saying that Arafat who suffers from a deep coma earlier Tuesday had died "are totally untrue," adding that "Arafat is still alive."
"The statement made public by General Christian Estripeau is still valid at 3:30 pm," he said.
Tuesday witnessed a flurry of conflicting reports on Arafat's fate, with some claiming he was dead and others saying his vital organs were still functioning.
