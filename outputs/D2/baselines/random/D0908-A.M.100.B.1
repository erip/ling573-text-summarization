"The secretary general is deeply concerned at the actions taken by the constitutional monarchy in Nepal on Tuesday to dissolve the government, impose a state of emergency and suspend civil liberties and freedom of expression," UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said in a statement.
The United States said Tuesday it was "deeply troubled" by an apparent setback to democracy in Nepal, where King Gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a state of emergency.
