Every wife of a reigning king has been known as Queen Consort except Queen Mary II who was joint sovereign with King William III.
In 1936, Edward VIII renounced the throne rather than give up Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee.
She was divorced from Charles when she died.
Prince Charles said Thursday he is "very excited" about his engagement to his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles.
There will be a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle," said Clarence House, Charles' residence and office.
