The United States said Tuesday it was "deeply troubled" by an apparent setback to democracy in Nepal, where King Gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a state of emergency.
Nepal's King Gyanendra named a new Cabinet Wednesday, a day after dismissing the government and declaring absolute power in a surprise move that he said was aimed at restoring democracy and ending a nine-year Maoist rebellion.
