Hong Kong Disneyland will stage its rehearsal from Aug.
Hong Kong Disneyland started its on-line tickets selling Friday and its spokesperson said the process had been smooth so far.
Many in Hong Kong are ready to give Mickey Mouse a big hug for bringing Disneyland to them.
Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong Disneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degrees and setting up "no fire zones" in kitchens, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.
