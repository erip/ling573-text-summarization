 Australian Environment Minister Ian Campbell set off Sunday on a diplomatic lobbying mission to Europe and the Pacific as part of a campaign to undermine Japan's push to increase its whale cull.
 Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to escalate its killing of whales.
 Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in the name of scientific research.
