 South Korea's envoy to the United States has offered his resignation, bowing to pressure over his alleged involvement in a major political slush fund scandal, officials said Tuesday.
 South Korea's spy agency publicly apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.
 South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun on Monday ordered the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to thoroughly investigate the allegation that one of the nation's biggest conglomerates provided huge slush funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
