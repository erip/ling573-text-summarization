An instrumented space-faring emissary called Huygens will separate Friday night from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn and begin a three-week descent of nearly 2 million miles to the planet's weird moon Titan to sample its atmosphere and its puzzling surface.
The Frisbee-shaped Huygens probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft Friday and began a risky 2.5-million-mile journey to the surface of Saturn's bizarre, smog-choked moon Titan.
The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mothership late Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of Titan.
