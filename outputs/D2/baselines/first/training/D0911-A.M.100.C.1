Chess legend Bobby Fischer was on Monday granted citizenship by the parliament of Iceland, a move which could allow him to avoid deportation from Japan to the United States where he is wanted for violating sanctions against the former Yugoslavia.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
