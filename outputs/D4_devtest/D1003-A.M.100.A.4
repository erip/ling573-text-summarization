 The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
 By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.
