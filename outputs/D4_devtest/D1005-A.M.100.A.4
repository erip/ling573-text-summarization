The stem cells in days-old embryos can develop into almost any kind of tissue -- brain, muscle, eyes -- leading to the hope that the cells could repair injured organs and cure disease.
 Cures for these and other diseases, many scientists now believe, could come from research into human embryonic stem cells.
 Three years ago, Bush limited federal funding of embryonic stem cell research to the 78 stem cell lines in existence.
