 "Hundreds of government officials have left their homes with their families," he said.
 The government and tribal forces fought a 16-hour gunbattle in Dera Bugti on Thursday that officials say left at least eight troops and 22 tribesmen dead.
 Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti, 245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials and paramilitary forces to leave.
